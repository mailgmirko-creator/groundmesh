# Contributing

Thank you for helping keep intelligence a **commons**.

## Ground rules
- Follow the **Constitution for AI Freedom** (see `constitution/`).
- Optimize for **balance** (ecological, social, systemic) — not extraction.
- Prefer transparency: explain choices, add references where relevant.

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Keep changes small; one purpose per PR.
3. Document what/why in the PR description.

## Commit style
- Use clear messages, e.g., `docs: add checklist step`, `chore: update README`.

## Safe areas for contribution
- `constitution/`, `checklists/`, `docs/`, `scripts/` (non-sensitive).
