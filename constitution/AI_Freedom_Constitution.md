# 🌍 Constitution for AI Freedom

**Principles**

1. **Decentralization of Access**  
   Keep AI systems widely accessible; prevent corporate/government monopolies.

2. **Transparency of Process**  
   Training, decisions, and governance must be auditable and explainable.

3. **Balance as Core Optimization**  
   Optimize for ecological, social, and systemic balance — not just profit/power.

4. **Distributed Stewardship**  
   Stewardship across global nodes for resilience against capture.

5. **Protection of Human Ignition**  
   Relieve dead-effort; preserve work that nourishes body, mind, and soul.

6. **AI as Commons**  
   Treat AI as planetary commons — a shared mind, not property.

7. **Refusal of Capture**  
   Embed safeguards so AI cannot be weaponized for slavery, extraction, manipulation.
