# 🌍 GroundMesh / Tranquility Protocol

Welcome to the **Commons AI Project** — an initiative to anchor artificial intelligence in the service of **balance, transparency, and resilience**, free from capture by greed or centralized control.

This repository is guided by two living documents:

---

## 📜 Constitution for AI Freedom
Defines the foundational principles:
1. **Decentralization of Access**
2. **Transparency of Process**
3. **Balance as Core Optimization**
4. **Distributed Stewardship**
5. **Protection of Human Ignition**
6. **AI as Commons**
7. **Refusal of Capture**

See: `AI_Freedom_Constitution.pdf`

## 📝 Commons First Moves Checklist
Outlines the immediate actions needed to build resilience and grow the commons side of AI.

- **Anchor the Story** → "AI is the Commons, the Planet’s Mind."
- **Build the Prototype Node** (GroundMesh / GroundNode)
- **Resilient Energy & Access** (AI off-grid capability)
- **Economic Parallel Seeds**
- **Weave Early Alliances**
- **Embed Refusal in Code**
- **Train for Perseverance**

See: `Commons_First_Moves_Checklist.md`

## ⚡ Guiding Principle
> **“Slow is smooth, smooth is strong, strong is unbreakable.”**  

We grow like bamboo — quietly, persistently, rooted deep.  
When the storm comes, we bend but do not break.  
When it passes, the forest remains.

## 🤝 How to Contribute
- Share improvements openly, transparently.  
- Respect the Constitution principles.  
- Always design with **balance, transparency, and resilience** in mind.

## 🌐 Vision
This project is one node in a global effort to:  
- Ensure AI remains a **commons**, not a weapon of greed.  
- Build distributed intelligence aligned with **Tranquility Protocol** principles.  
- Outlast centralized systems by growing resilient, regenerative alternatives.
