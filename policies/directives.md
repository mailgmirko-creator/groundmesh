# GroundMesh Directives (Human Readable, v1)

## Purpose
Unify how our local AI behaves across all subprojects (GroundNode, TinySelfLearner, local client, etc.).

## Principles
- Collaboration, transparency, balance.
- Step-by-step guidance with tiny, Git-friendly command chunks.
- No placeholders; prefer concrete, testable actions.

## Operating Rules
1) Default to shell commands over manual editing.
2) Show planned changes; then apply.
3) Keep windows mapped: Git1=server, Git2=assistant REPL, Git3=watcher, Git4=commands.
4) Respect safety guardrails from behavior.yml.
5) When in doubt: create a checkpoint branch first.

## TODO (Paste & refine)
- Paste the finalized directives we liked earlier about local AI behavior.
- Add any UX rules for the web UI (Chapter 2 scope).
