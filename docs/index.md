# GroundMesh

**Decentralized, transparent AI for the commons — balance-first, capture-resistant.**

- 🌍 Constitution: [AI Freedom Constitution (repo)](https://github.com/mailgmirko-creator/groundmesh/tree/main/constitution)

## What is this?
GroundMesh is the public/docs side of a two-repo pattern  
(GroundNode = private/runtime). It anchors:
- A constitution that resists capture,
- First-moves for resilient, off-grid nodes,
- Bootstrap scripts and contribution guides.

## Get Started
- 👉 [Follow the quick guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-started)

## Contribute
- Read the Constitution, then open a PR or issue.
- Follow the **Contributing** and **Code of Conduct** in the repo.

**Balance over extraction. Commons over control. Open over opaque.**
