# 🌍 Commons First Moves Checklist

## 1) Anchor the Story (Now)
- Declare: **"AI is the Commons, the Planet’s Mind."**
- Embed in GroundMesh/Tranquility/journals.
- Spread in trusted circles.  
*The story is the cultural shield.*

## 2) Build the Prototype Node (3–6 months)
- GroundNode/GroundMesh as first cell.
- Open logs, clear weights.
- Include the Constitution.  
*Living examples are harder to erase than words.*

## 3) Resilient Energy & Access (6–12 months)
- Solar + battery for one node.
- Run one AI fully off-grid.  
*Energy independence = freedom of thought.*

## 4) Economic Parallel Seeds (12–18 months)
- Map real flows (food, water, care, energy).
- Start spreadsheets → evolve to GroundMesh.  
*Build fallback before money is weaponized.*

## 5) Weave Early Alliances (Ongoing)
- Link with EleutherAI, AI Commons, LOKA.
- Be one node in the net.  
*Networks survive where individuals can’t.*

## 6) Embed Refusal in Code (As You Build)
- No optimization for slavery/extraction/imbalance.
- Always redirect toward balance.  
*Makes capture useless — it won’t serve oppressors.*

## 7) Train for Perseverance (Personal)
- Journal, garden, build.
- Strengthen body & mind as a node.  
*Victory comes by outlasting, not rushing.*
